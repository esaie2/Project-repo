Array Definitions:

subjects[]: An array to store the names of the subjects.

marks[][]: A 2D array to store the marks for each subject and test.

Input Marks:

The program prompts the user to input marks for each subject and test (Assignment, Coursework, Mid-term, and End-of-term).

Calculate Averages:

The program calculates the average marks for each subject by summing up the marks of all tests and dividing by the number of tests.

Output Averages:

Finally, the program displays the average marks for each subject.
